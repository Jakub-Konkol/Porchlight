Porchlight
==========

Porchlight is a preprocessing aid for spectroscopists and for students to learn preprocessing.

Features
--------

Porchlight allows you to open a variety of spectral files and immediately visualize the preprocessing you perform on your spectra.
This way, you can get a better intuition for the impact various preprocessing methods have.
The software is also designed for the classroom as well, with important features to support learning such as dynamic plot axis labelling.
